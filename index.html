    <h4>Abstract</h4>
    <p>This work in progress research-to-practice study describes the development of a new undergraduate research training site on Quantum Machine Learning (QML), hosted at Arizona State University, a large Hispanic-Serving Institution. The objectives of this project are to a) recruit and prepare students from diverse pathways to increase representation of those traditionally underrepresented in QML research, b) increase awareness of career opportunities in the QML field, c) engage students in theoretical and experimental quantum information processing and machine learning (ML), d) motivate students to continue QML research into graduate school, and e) provide professional development training including presenting to stakeholders, developing publications/patents, and building an awareness on social implications, ethics, and privacy. The project adopts an integrative theory, application, and hands-on training approach by immersing undergraduate students in ML algorithm and quantum computing studies with hands-on quantum circuit design tasks. Participants are embedded in research labs, guided by graduate students and faculty mentors on quantum computing research studies. The program is evaluated by both the Center for Evaluating the Research Pipeline (CERP) and an independent evaluator. Formative and summative assessments include pre- and post-surveys, a mid-point check-in survey, and a document review of program deliverables. Findings are described in a final evaluation report. This paper describes the importance of introducing QML research at the undergraduate level, methods for recruiting a diverse group of participants, program format, research projects, and preliminary program evaluation results.</p>

    <h4>Abstract</h4>
    <p>Utility-scale solar arrays require specialized inspection methods for detecting faulty panels. Photovoltaic (PV) panel faults caused by weather, ground leakage, circuit issues, temperature, environment, age, and other damage can take many forms but often symptomatically exhibit temperature differences. Included is a mini survey to review these common faults and PV array fault detection approaches. Among these, infrared thermography cameras are a powerful tool for improving solar panel inspection in the field. These can be combined with other technologies, including image processing and machine learning. This position paper examines several computer vision algorithms that automate thermal anomaly detection in infrared imagery. We demonstrate our infrared thermography data collection approach, the PV thermal imagery benchmark dataset, and the measured performance of image processing transformations, including the Hough Transform for PV segmentation. The results of this implementation are presented with a discussion of future work.</p>

    <h4>Abstract</h4>
    <p>Real-time monitoring and control of individual solar panels in a photovoltaic (PV) array can improve efficiency and reduce the probability of hazardous situations. This paper proposes the design and implementation of a real-time Intelligent Monitoring and Control Device (IMCD) to measure PV parameters such as temperature, voltage, current, and irradiance from individual solar panels. The proposed IMCD uses an embedded machine-learning (ML) algorithm for detecting and classifying four key conditions of the solar panel: partial shading, soiling, extreme soiling, and the standard test condition (STC). IMCDs connect with solar panels and with a control center using an integrated data transceiver. The hardware consists of an Arduino UNO transmitter that is used for data collection, an Arduino Nano BLE 33 Sense receiver for PV measurement, and an integrated processor for real-time fault detection using embedded ML. The training of the embedded ML models and their real-world testing and validation are presented in this paper. Comparisons with cloud-based ML algorithms and the use of bagging ensemble techniques to increase fault detection accuracy are also discussed in this paper.</p>

    <h4>Abstract</h4>
    <p>Continuous monitoring and fault detection for solar arrays can increase overall power efficiency and prevent hazardous situations. This paper proposes an intelligent monitoring and control device (IMCD) that can measure relevant photovoltaic (PV) parameters such as temperature, voltage, current, and irradiance. Our system design is based on an Arduino microcontroller that acquires and processes data from a PV panel. The design is such that data collected from the PV panels can be transmitted to a networked computer using an integrated Zigbee wireless transceiver. The design has provisions for embedded machine learning (ML) and then cloud-based ML algorithms trained to detect and classify PV faults in real time. The IMCD design can reconfigure the connection topology of a PV array using relays. These relays can switch from series to parallel connection upon command and hence reconfigure the PV connection topology to optimize power output for different shading conditions.</p>

    <h4>Abstract</h4>
    <p>Continuous real-time solar system monitoring for fault detection and classification can improve solar panel efficiency and overall output. In this study, we developed and implemented a real-time PV fault detection system based on machine learning. The system was implemented on an 18kW testbed facility which consists of 104 solar panels located at the ASU Research Park. Each solar panel is connected to a smart monitoring device (SMD) which obtains real-time voltage and current measurements. SMDs are attached to each panel and transmit all the acquired data to a server that is connected to the internet. We implement fault detection using real-time measurements and various neural network architectures. We train and test both fully connected and dropout neural networks with different dropout regularization. We use both a real-time dataset and a synthetic dataset and present comparative results. We train and classify for the following conditions: soiled panels, shaded and degraded panels, and standard test conditions.</p>

    <h4>Abstract</h4>
    <p>This paper aims to improve the efficiency of the garbage collection process by developing a system for monitoring waste levels in garbage bins using ultrasonic sensors and connecting them to Arduino Uno board for sending the measurements like the amount of waste level to the user. Two smart dustbins were designed for home use and public use which are monitored in real-time using the mobile applications. Notification alerts are also sent when the amount of waste exceeds a certain threshold level. These dustbins are connected wirelessly using a Zigbee based transceiver in the form of a mesh network to facilitate the transfer of the amount of waste present in these dustbins to the nearest garbage collection truck and an optimized shortest route to be followed by the garbage collector truck is calculated. The proposed system is user friendly, compact and cost-effective requiring minimum human intervention.</p>

    <h4>Abstract</h4>
    <p>Environment monitoring and control has become a vital part of present-day to control air pollution and help in agriculture, fishery, shipping and military operations. Environment monitoring using traditional manually operated Weather Monitoring Stations requires skilled technicians for operation, is not scalable, and demands human intervention, which increases the cost of the Weather Monitoring Station. To address these issues, authors have attempted to design and develop E-Sense, an Internet of Things based environment monitoring system. E-Sense measures important environment parameters like temperature, humidity, air quality index, CO concentrations, rain and light. The data collected from the sensors is transmitted to ThingSpeak using the ESP8266 Wi-Fi module. The ThingSpeak helps in analyzing the data and present it in graphical and tabular forms. Additionally, E-Sense creates a heat map of the monitored area. A testbed implementation and experimentation show that the system works without human intervention, is user friendly, compact, and is cost-efficient.</p>

    <h2 class="section-heading">Beyond Work</h2>
    <p class="section-intro">Outside of my professional work, I find joy in traveling to new places and experiencing diverse cultures. I carry my camera and drone wherever I go, capturing landscapes, moments, and stories that might otherwise go unnoticed. For me, photography is more than just taking pictures‚Äîit‚Äôs about preserving emotions and perspectives that words alone cannot express. I also enjoy editing my captures to bring out the essence of each scene, curating them into visual stories that I love to share with others. Traveling and creating in this way fuels my curiosity, inspires fresh perspectives, and keeps me connected to the beauty of the world around me.</p>
